We assume that the mean of each feature is zero; otherwise the first step is to center the data at zero by subtracting the mean of each feature.\n",

We impose that $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_k}$ is a unit vector, i.e., $|| \\boldsymbol{\\phi_k} ||=\\sum_j (\\phi_{k,j})^2=1$. Indeed, there exists an infinity of vectors that have the same direction, so we need to select one, and the unit vector leads to some interesting properties that we will discover below.\n",

        "\n",
        "The first principal component is the direction of the largest variance. More explicitly, our problem consists in finding the weights $(\\phi_{1,1}, \\phi_{1,2}, ..., \\phi_{1,p})$ that maximizes the variance of the projections $\\boldsymbol{z_1}=(z_{1,1}, z_{1,2},..., z_{1,n})$, such that $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_1}$ is a unit vector.

        "\n",
        "However, in practice, the principal components are computed differently. Let's take a step back and reconsider our optimization problem above. When solving it, by adding a Lagrangian multiplier $\\lambda_1$ and taking the derivatives with respect to each weight $\\phi_{1,j}$, we obtain, with some reshuffling:\n",

        "\n",
        "If you are familiar with linear algebra, you will have recognized this equation: it means that the ***principal components are the [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) of the covariance matrix of our features***!\n",

        "Not only that, we can show that, because $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_k}$ are unit vectors, the ***eigenvalues*** ($\\lambda_k$) are equal to the ***variance*** of the projections. Hence, the first principal component is the eigenvector of the covariance matrix with the largest eigenvalues, and so on.\n",

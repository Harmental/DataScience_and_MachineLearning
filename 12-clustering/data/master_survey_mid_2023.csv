11/13/2023 14:21:38,Because I think it was ideal for someone that want to do something related to programming and economy ,Data Science ,That is very practical ,"The level of programming is very high at the start, it should be lower. Because we weren't supposed to know that much about programming "
11/13/2023 14:22:03,"Only ""2 semesters"" and in general it's a important and interesting topic",Finance, ,Too many project at the same time
11/13/2023 14:22:18,Because I wanted to improve my knolwdge of IT. I started to study that field during high school.,A similar master in a foreign university,I like that in this master there are a lot of technical assignment not just theoretical aspects,I like how it is
11/13/2023 14:22:20,I wanted a Master Degree that would marry business and technology. This was one of the few proposed by HEC.,Management - Business Analytics,"Small class, a lot of projects in which we have to work with different companies","Nothing, I like it the way it is. Even if it's a lot of work."
11/13/2023 14:22:28,"Only 2 lecture semesters, very concret and practical courses. Very up to date studies","Master in Management, orientation BA","Coding in python, the ISP course which shows all the ""behind the scene"" and starting to see a little bit better what I'm actually gonna do in ma futur. ","It is maybe too early now but in a near futur, Generative AI will change how certain jobs are done. Maybe a course about how to use AI in a firm to know it's full potential "
11/13/2023 14:22:32,because later i'd like to work in the management on digital project,master  in management,the practical work like coding ,better coordination between each course for the assignments
11/13/2023 14:22:36,I want to learn more about SI,Finance,"diversity of the lessons, projects, ",explanation of some lessons are bad.

11/13/2023 14:22:48,"I wanted to have a broader approach than the management BIA master, I don't want to be fighting for the same job as epfl students. I want to have a broad panel of opportunities since I don't wan't to work for companies that don't suit my moral compass.",BIA Management ; SOL management ,"Loads of new concepts, very different topics","Don't put the 3.5 blocus when we do so much group work.

11/13/2023 14:23:32,Because it’s a technical master ,Business analysis,Learn new things far than business ,More video for theoretical parts

11/13/2023 14:23:51,Very interesting and future oriented,Finance,Interesting and I like the class,"Totally lost during the first weeks, as I have never worked with python or java. I would recommend to give a quick introduction to those programs, especially in python."
11/13/2023 14:23:51,I wanted to be more aware on how I could help companies with new technology to improve their process into the digital transformation.,Innovation abroad,I think the topic related to the practice are great. Some courses are very near the need of the companies and it is great for us to work directly in the field. ,Some of the classes are not up to date... with new technologies we could have some new models and new tools. Some course materials are based on old theory and not rewritten sice 2017
11/13/2023 14:24:10,Because I really like IT and I wanted to learn more about specific subjects like ML.,Master in Corporate Finance,I really like the courses that have a technical approach like Data Science and Machine Learning and Software Architecture.,I think the courses that are a bit less technical should have more concrete projects
11/13/2023 14:24:15,I was always interested in IT and how the digital world works,none,The projects and implementations (not only theory) ,projects + exam in every class
11/13/2023 14:24:22,"I like technology in general and I wanted to learn more concrete stuff. 
Also because this is a popular subject in our days and I think our profile is attractive for the market",Management business administration ,"Learn and practice. There is a lot of project related to the courses and this is the better way for me to learn.

11/13/2023 14:25:40,"I would like to pursue a career in the tech industry, or get tech type job in a firm. Specifically, in the filed of data analytics, data science, machine learning and/or digital transformation",Business Analytics,"I enjoy the programming elements the most, precisely the data science course is the one which I found the most interesting and relevant","All our courses are around 3h30 and for some it is not suitable. Some courses like SOAR or stratégie digitale the profressor only talks for the whole period of time and it is very difficult to follow. Speficically for SOAR where our professor only talkes about programming but we don't have any demonstrations nor de have any exercises to practice. 

I prefer the format where the lesson is devided into two parts, first theory then practical application."
